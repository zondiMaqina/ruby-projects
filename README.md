## CEASOR CYPHER

## SUB STRINGS 

### Aim from project
The aim from this is to count the amount of recognisable strings from your own dictionary in a full string object set whether they are full strings or sub-strings 

> [!NOTE]
> The dictionary will be hard coded by myself 

there will be a method that will take the sentnce you create and your dictionary and will return the amount of words recognisable from your dictionary in your sentnce 

```
sentence = "Hello there world" ; # can be user input => gets.chomp
dictionary = ['hell', 'hello', 'world'] ;

def sub_strings(string, dictionary)
 ...
end ;

dub_strings(sentence, dictionary) # => {:hell=> 2, :world=> 1, :hello=> 1} 
```
